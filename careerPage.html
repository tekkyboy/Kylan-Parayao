  <h1>Academic Career and Work Experience</h1>
  <body style="background-color:#5DADE2;">
    <p style="color:white;">
    I am currently a fourth year student at Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Science, expected to graduate in Spring 2022. I am interested in ensuring that mankind uses technology responsibly.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:#F5B041;">
      Academic History and Career Aspirations
    </h2>
    <p style="color:white;">
      I attended El Modena High School from 2014 to 2018. I have to admit, as a teenager I had no idea what I wanted to study in college. I found myself interested learning about every type of industry. I opted to apply as a Computer Science major as I believed that this degree would satisfy my everlasting curiosity of understanding as much as possible about life and society.
      <br><br>
      In Fall 2018, I was admitted to the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona as a Computer Science major. Through college, I have discovered that I prefer projects in developing software applications. I have also developed an active interest as to how technology influences our human morality.
      <br><br>
      I am motivated to further enhance my skills in software engineering and development and I hope that one day I will be able to make an impact on the world for the best of mankind. I would like to see myself in the technology industry as a legal consultant, ensuring that whatever new technologies we develop will be as humane and ethical as possible.
